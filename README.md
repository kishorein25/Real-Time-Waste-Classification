## 🧠 Abstract
A practical real-time waste classification system has been developed to promote sustainable waste management. The system uses a CNN to automatically classify waste as biodegradable or non-biodegradable from captured images. A microcontroller activates servo motors to open the correct dustbin lid for touch-free disposal, improving hygiene and recycling efficiency. The system is designed for domestic, public, and industrial applications.
